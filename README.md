# Vélib flows in Paris

Vélib (a mix of 'vélo' and 'liberté' french words for 'bike' and 'freedom') is Parisian the public bike system.

Depending on the 'arrondissement' you live in, it can be tricky to find a Vélib on the morning.
Do Vélibs tend to migrate towards the center of Paris in the morning? Let's find out.

Do to so, I used two URLs to request the necessary data to the Vélib API, available on :
https://www.velib-metropole.fr/donnees-open-data-gbfs-du-service-velib-metropole

and organized the data in plots in order to visualize the Vélib flows throughout a normal week day with no particular event (extreme weather, strike, pandemic)

Here is the plot showing the variation of the number of available Vélibs per station, clearing proving the existence of a flux of Vélibs from the periphery to the city center.
