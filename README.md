# Vélib flows in Paris

Depending on the 'arrondissement' you live in, it can be hard to find a Vélib on the morning.
How much do Vélibs migrate to the center of Paris on mornings ? Let's find out.

Do to so, I used two URLs to request the necessary data, available on :
https://www.velib-metropole.fr/donnees-open-data-gbfs-du-service-velib-metropole

And organized the data in plots in order to visualize the Vélib flows throughout a normal day.
